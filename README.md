# Enfo's Team Survival: MTE Edition

_Enfo's Team Survival: MTExtended Edition_ is a custom map for the game WarCraft III. 

_Enfo's Team Survival_ is a Hero-centered team survival inspired by an old multi-user dungeon called DragonRealms. Choose a Hero, defend against waves of monsters, and hold out longer than the enemy team. _MTExtended Edition_ is an open-sourced continuation of the abandoned _MT Edition_ by Pedro (mecatronic) and Bruno (Prytoluk). It picks up where the developers left off at version 1.93 released in 2011.
